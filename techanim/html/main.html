    <td>1. Intro to Animation</td>
    <td>
      After finishing my animation/special effect minor in CMU, introduction to animation is a pretty familiar topic for me. However it is still interesting how my experiences affects the way I percieve this topic over time. For example, taking technical character animation gave me insights on keyframe animation and animation principles, as well as the rigging course I took last semester helped me to better understand skinning and weight painting issues. I used some physics simulation in maya in animation, art and technology class, and back then it was just the matter of how to use it. I am excited to learn technicalities behind it and where animation industry is heading towards from recent studies.

    <td>1.5 Motion Capture Demo</td>
    <td>
      I've been to mocap lab several times during other animation courses and doing research project with Sejoon, so most content were stuffs I already knew. But nevertheless I think it is always worth being down there and also there were things that now I understand or I have questions since I've been using the old database over the summer internship. It was nice to see Justin again.

    <td>2. Inverse Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      It's been a while I last took graphics and did any of the mathy stuff with matrices, which means my inverse kinematics and jacobians are pretty rusty. Some math was actually very refreshing. I think I'll do the animation and one kinematic related thing with the miniproject. The options were pretty interesting and I want to do something with scripting.

    <td>3. More Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      So we did some reviews on different Jacobian methods we covered last lecture and talked about newer inverse kinematics and the trend in the technology. We looked at some interesting application of IK and some things really got my attention. The sega example (The one with constraints) was pretty impressive for the time. I was wondering how maya does it now or is the sega one a completely different approach? When we were talking about the parallelized ik computation I was thinking of my 462 IK which was pretty slow. Maybe some adaptaion of the technique would have improved the performance. Lastly the FABRIC paper was impressive too in a sense that you can do so much stuff with just IK. I usually use FK for the upper body and IK for the foot and thought it would be impossible to replicate movements with just IK, but seems like it's not true.

    <td>4. Skinning</td>
    <td>
      Today we talked about skinning, which was a topic I was looking forward to have a class about. I was always wondering what the different options in maya was (I guess I was not that curious about them to actually look up) and wanted to learn how skinning is done. Also skinnning is a extremely time consuming and tidious process so I was exited to learn how to make it better. We talked about linear blend skinning and dual quaternian skinning, but I think the physics simulation integration was something I want to look more into if I have more time. The concept of not having to keyframe every secondary motion was very tempting. Also I wonder how heatmap skinning works? When I had to skin in maya I had an advice that starting with heatmap skinning will give better results.

    <td>Paper presentation 1</td>
    <td>
      There were three paper presentations about chracter rigging. Two of them were paper I was also interested in, so it was nice to actually learn what the papers were about. The Toonsynth one was about generating stylized 2d animation with existing sequence by decomposing the character sprite into different body parts like a puppet. I thought the paper was about generating animation from a character illustration, but apparently it requires a little more artist interaction. The empirical jaw rig was another interesting paper. The disney crews came up with a jaw rig that takes care of specific movement of actual jaw movement by collecting a lot of data. Seems like the trend of animation related research is really going to the data driven path. I didn't really get the math part but I think I got the gist of it like mapping the 3d space where the tip of the jaw can be to parameter space so that the artists can ineract with the rig.. (If I got it wrong please tell me). The natural language scene creation was cool too. It used some mixture of natural language processor and a tree structure to compose a scene to generate plausible scene from sentences. I thought this one would be really usefull for the artists since it is pretty hard to randomly come up with a scene. However, one thing that I was concerened is that since the neural network is trained with limited dataset, won't there be not enough noise to the composition? aka, won't the result would be repetitive or in similar composision? Well I think at that point the artists should fidget around with the created scene to get diversity.

    <td>Mini project presentation</td>
    <td>
      Seems like majority of the class did the first task as their prime one (including me!) and it was fun to watch different walk cycles. I learned my walk cycle in technical animation class two years ago, and we took plenty of time (about a month) to make a one good walk cycle with critics inbetween. So I guess it was inevitable that many of the walk cycles were a little bit stiff to my standard:) But all other technical stuff especially the jacobians were really cool. I wish I could have done that seeing they were integrated with maya. I liked the unity one.

    <td>5. Simulations</td>
    <td>
      This lecture was about introduction to simulations. I feel like I should have heard this things back in graphics but I really can't tell. I do remember forward/backward Eulers though, so I am proud of myself. I don't think I have any more to add to this topic.. especially since most of the lecture was going over differnt integration methods and introducing ways to simulate different physical phenomenon such as rigid body, collisions and cloth.

    <td>6. Cloth</td>
    <td>
      It was interesting that there are different ways to simulate cloth and also people have been studying this for a really long time. Also the mini projects were out but I really don't think I can start them before spring break.. Anyways, there were a lot of paper introduced about different approaches, addition to an approach made, and tries to make cloth simulation more intuitive for the artists. I think I get the very basic how cloth can be simulated with springs and so on, but I probably have to look into it deeper to figure out how to actually implement one. I think for mini project, I will make a simulator and make a scene using simulation? I have a scene in my mind where something is shattered by a bullet. The paper that I can remember the most was the one that tried to capture different qualities of cloth by surveying how changing different parameters will give different feelings to the artists. I think it interested me in a sense that this is very subjective to people and the research actually used human responses to contruct their model. I think this is the first time I saw such format of research. I couldn't tell if the result was believable or not, but I think it is a valid try.
