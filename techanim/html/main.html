    <td>
      After finishing my animation/special effect minor in CMU, introduction to animation is a pretty familiar topic for me. However it is still interesting how my experiences affects the way I percieve this topic over time. For example, taking technical character animation gave me insights on keyframe animation and animation principles, as well as the rigging course I took last semester helped me to better understand skinning and weight painting issues. I used some physics simulation in maya in animation, art and technology class, and back then it was just the matter of how to use it. I am excited to learn technicalities behind it and where animation industry is heading towards from recent studies.
