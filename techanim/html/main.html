    <td>1. Intro to Animation</td>
    <td>
      After finishing my animation/special effect minor in CMU, introduction to animation is a pretty familiar topic for me. However it is still interesting how my experiences affects the way I percieve this topic over time. For example, taking technical character animation gave me insights on keyframe animation and animation principles, as well as the rigging course I took last semester helped me to better understand skinning and weight painting issues. I used some physics simulation in maya in animation, art and technology class, and back then it was just the matter of how to use it. I am excited to learn technicalities behind it and where animation industry is heading towards from recent studies.

    <td>
      I've been to mocap lab several times during other animation courses and doing research project with Sejoon, so most content were stuffs I already knew. But nevertheless I think it is always worth being down there and also there were things that now I understand or I have questions since I've been using the old database over the summer internship. It was nice to see Justin again.

    <td>2. Inverse Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      It's been a while I last took graphics and did any of the mathy stuff with matrices, which means my inverse kinematics and jacobians are pretty rusty. Some math was actually very refreshing. I think I'll do the animation and one kinematic related thing with the miniproject. The options were pretty interesting and I want to do something with scripting.
