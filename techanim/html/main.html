    <td>1. Intro to Animation</td>
    <td>
      After finishing my animation/special effect minor in CMU, introduction to animation is a pretty familiar topic for me. However it is still interesting how my experiences affects the way I percieve this topic over time. For example, taking technical character animation gave me insights on keyframe animation and animation principles, as well as the rigging course I took last semester helped me to better understand skinning and weight painting issues. I used some physics simulation in maya in animation, art and technology class, and back then it was just the matter of how to use it. I am excited to learn technicalities behind it and where animation industry is heading towards from recent studies.

    <td>
      I've been to mocap lab several times during other animation courses and doing research project with Sejoon, so most content were stuffs I already knew. But nevertheless I think it is always worth being down there and also there were things that now I understand or I have questions since I've been using the old database over the summer internship. It was nice to see Justin again.

    <td>2. Inverse Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      It's been a while I last took graphics and did any of the mathy stuff with matrices, which means my inverse kinematics and jacobians are pretty rusty. Some math was actually very refreshing. I think I'll do the animation and one kinematic related thing with the miniproject. The options were pretty interesting and I want to do something with scripting.

    <td>3. More Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      So we did some reviews on different Jacobian methods we covered last lecture and talked about newer inverse kinematics and the trend in the technology. We looked at some interesting application of IK and some things really got my attention. The sega example (The one with constraints) was pretty impressive for the time. I was wondering how maya does it now or is the sega one a completely different approach? When we were talking about the parallelized ik computation I was thinking of my 462 IK which was pretty slow. Maybe some adaptaion of the technique would have improved the performance. Lastly the FABRIC paper was impressive too in a sense that you can do so much stuff with just IK. I usually use FK for the upper body and IK for the foot and thought it would be impossible to replicate movements with just IK, but seems like it's not true.

    <td>4. Skinning</td>
    <td>
      Today we talked about skinning, which was a topic I was looking forward to have a class about. I was always wondering what the different options in maya was (I guess I was not that curious about them to actually look up) and wanted to learn how skinning is done. Also skinnning is a extremely time consuming and tidious process so I was exited to learn how to make it better. We talked about linear blend skinning and dual quaternian skinning, but I think the physics simulation integration was something I want to look more into if I have more time. The concept of not having to keyframe every secondary motion was very tempting. Also I wonder how heatmap skinning works? When I had to skin in maya I had an advice that starting with heatmap skinning will give better results.
