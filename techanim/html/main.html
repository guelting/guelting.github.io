    <td>1. Intro to Animation</td>
    <td>
      After finishing my animation/special effect minor in CMU, introduction to animation is a pretty familiar topic for me. However it is still interesting how my experiences affects the way I percieve this topic over time. For example, taking technical character animation gave me insights on keyframe animation and animation principles, as well as the rigging course I took last semester helped me to better understand skinning and weight painting issues. I used some physics simulation in maya in animation, art and technology class, and back then it was just the matter of how to use it. I am excited to learn technicalities behind it and where animation industry is heading towards from recent studies.

    <td>1.5 Motion Capture Demo</td>
    <td>
      I've been to mocap lab several times during other animation courses and doing research project with Sejoon, so most content were stuffs I already knew. But nevertheless I think it is always worth being down there and also there were things that now I understand or I have questions since I've been using the old database over the summer internship. It was nice to see Justin again.

    <td>2. Inverse Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      It's been a while I last took graphics and did any of the mathy stuff with matrices, which means my inverse kinematics and jacobians are pretty rusty. Some math was actually very refreshing. I think I'll do the animation and one kinematic related thing with the miniproject. The options were pretty interesting and I want to do something with scripting.

    <td>3. More Kinematics</td>
    <td>
      So we did some reviews on different Jacobian methods we covered last lecture and talked about newer inverse kinematics and the trend in the technology. We looked at some interesting application of IK and some things really got my attention. The sega example (The one with constraints) was pretty impressive for the time. I was wondering how maya does it now or is the sega one a completely different approach? When we were talking about the parallelized ik computation I was thinking of my 462 IK which was pretty slow. Maybe some adaptaion of the technique would have improved the performance. Lastly the FABRIC paper was impressive too in a sense that you can do so much stuff with just IK. I usually use FK for the upper body and IK for the foot and thought it would be impossible to replicate movements with just IK, but seems like it's not true.

    <td>4. Skinning</td>
    <td>
      Today we talked about skinning, which was a topic I was looking forward to have a class about. I was always wondering what the different options in maya was (I guess I was not that curious about them to actually look up) and wanted to learn how skinning is done. Also skinnning is a extremely time consuming and tidious process so I was exited to learn how to make it better. We talked about linear blend skinning and dual quaternian skinning, but I think the physics simulation integration was something I want to look more into if I have more time. The concept of not having to keyframe every secondary motion was very tempting. Also I wonder how heatmap skinning works? When I had to skin in maya I had an advice that starting with heatmap skinning will give better results.

    <td>Paper presentation 1</td>
    <td>
      There were three paper presentations about chracter rigging. Two of them were paper I was also interested in, so it was nice to actually learn what the papers were about. The Toonsynth one was about generating stylized 2d animation with existing sequence by decomposing the character sprite into different body parts like a puppet. I thought the paper was about generating animation from a character illustration, but apparently it requires a little more artist interaction. The empirical jaw rig was another interesting paper. The disney crews came up with a jaw rig that takes care of specific movement of actual jaw movement by collecting a lot of data. Seems like the trend of animation related research is really going to the data driven path. I didn't really get the math part but I think I got the gist of it like mapping the 3d space where the tip of the jaw can be to parameter space so that the artists can ineract with the rig.. (If I got it wrong please tell me). The natural language scene creation was cool too. It used some mixture of natural language processor and a tree structure to compose a scene to generate plausible scene from sentences. I thought this one would be really usefull for the artists since it is pretty hard to randomly come up with a scene. However, one thing that I was concerened is that since the neural network is trained with limited dataset, won't there be not enough noise to the composition? aka, won't the result would be repetitive or in similar composision? Well I think at that point the artists should fidget around with the created scene to get diversity.

    <td>Mini project presentation</td>
    <td>
      Seems like majority of the class did the first task as their prime one (including me!) and it was fun to watch different walk cycles. I learned my walk cycle in technical animation class two years ago, and we took plenty of time (about a month) to make a one good walk cycle with critics inbetween. So I guess it was inevitable that many of the walk cycles were a little bit stiff to my standard:) But all other technical stuff especially the jacobians were really cool. I wish I could have done that seeing they were integrated with maya. I liked the unity one.

    <td>5. Simulations</td>
    <td>
      This lecture was about introduction to simulations. I feel like I should have heard this things back in graphics but I really can't tell. I do remember forward/backward Eulers though, so I am proud of myself. I don't think I have any more to add to this topic.. especially since most of the lecture was going over differnt integration methods and introducing ways to simulate different physical phenomenon such as rigid body, collisions and cloth.

    <td>6. Cloth</td>
    <td>
      It was interesting that there are different ways to simulate cloth and also people have been studying this for a really long time. Also the mini projects were out but I really don't think I can start them before spring break.. Anyways, there were a lot of paper introduced about different approaches, addition to an approach made, and tries to make cloth simulation more intuitive for the artists. I think I get the very basic how cloth can be simulated with springs and so on, but I probably have to look into it deeper to figure out how to actually implement one. I think for mini project, I will make a simulator and make a scene using simulation? I have a scene in my mind where something is shattered by a bullet. The paper that I can remember the most was the one that tried to capture different qualities of cloth by surveying how changing different parameters will give different feelings to the artists. I think it interested me in a sense that this is very subjective to people and the research actually used human responses to contruct their model. I think this is the first time I saw such format of research. I couldn't tell if the result was believable or not, but I think it is a valid try.

    <td>8. More Fluids</td>
    <td>
      I liked the visuals of different simulation methods. To see different simulations in one view made it quite clear which method is stable and which is believable. (Sorry I've been neglecting this webpage for the past month and honestly I can't quite remember the details..)

      There was plenty of interesting papers regarding fluid simulations. The paper I liked the most was the water surface wavelets. The demo was cool though I was not sure about the implementation. I think I am generally weaker on simulations and my interest lies on animation part..

    <td>10. Final project pitch</td>
    <td>
      Seems like most of the projects are pretty sophisticated and seems very cool. I think I'll go for the space key animation idea. I also liked the mocap idea from the first person who presented. I'm also interested in what the result of group chose the restricted fluid simulation will be like.

    <td>11. Miniproject 2 presentation</td>
    <td>
      I feel like everybody else has done more than what I have done.. Many people chose unity for their presentation and it looked cool. I feel like I could also do that for my final project if I can't deal with Maya. I wonder how people did the contact force. Maybe if possible, will it be an option in the future to share the code that people coded? It might be useful for people to go through other's code and see what they actually did.

    <td>12. Particle based systems</td>
    <td>
      First of all, the particle based system was so cool! It was surprising that such simple looking algorithm would give realistic results. Though I wonder how they actually render particles as solid objects. (Some kind of edge detection?) There's definitly a lot more about different constraints and fluid/solid simulation..

    <td>13. Deformables</td>
    <td>
      So from What I understand, most of the simulation routines are pretty similar.. It's just the detail that is slightly different? I was interested in how deformable objects were dealt with technically, and this class helped me to understand a little bit more of their implementation. However, I think I should go through the papers again in my own time to grasp exactly what it's all about.. Still a little bit confused.. The neo-hookean model looked very believable, and I especially liked the deformables with change of rest shape that made objects have life.

    <td>14. Paper presentation 3</td>
    <td>
      The papers today were very interesting. The first one, boundary method was cool in a sense that they are trying to simulate the water in a set boundary. This paper did something weird in my sense, which was to create water molecule from the edge of the boundary and kill water molecules that are out of the boundary. Apparently this way they can simulate waves in a cup or a bowl. I was not so sure about the second and third paper, the fast energy projection paper and the Face simulation paper, but the Wave based sound synthesis was super interesting. I always thought the sound would be recoreded and added to the scene as a secondary component, however, I never thought of simulating the sound with physical simulaion. The concept to see air, which is the transmission medium of the sound, as fluid and simulate the sound was new to me. There were also few optimization with the sound since it needs a lot of sampling.

    <td>15. Faces and Hair</td>
    <td>
       We talked about face in last class briefly in face paper, and today we looked into more papers. Stylized facial animation paper explored how to use blendshape in more extreme. I think the results were pretty cool tho other classmates commented that they look little bit unnatural. We also talked about combining physical simulations and facial expression, which was the enhancing facialrigs with simulation paper. The point that I was amazed was the fact that people actually try to mimick the real word to such detail. Anatomical facial rig followed next. I'm not sure how I feel about these.. I think I prefer the more stylized animation over realistic ones. It's very hard to make realistic simulations to completely match the reality. I wanted to see more of the hair simulation!

    <td>16. Human body</td>
    <td>
      We went over another paper today at the start of the lecture about hybird grains. It was a paper about how to combine discrete simulation with continuous simulation to simulate granular meterials. The concept was pretty solid and the results were believable however seems like some of the simulation the hybrid model shows slightly different behavior than the ground truth. Also why would they compared to other simulation not reality?
      The human body papers were mostly simulating how skin works. All were great efforts but I guess body simulation is still in progress. I thought the data driven soft tissue animation was not realistic when they rotated the body and computational body-building looked quite stiff. The foot paper was quite new. I recently got into drawing prostetic foots, and I realized that the foot model they were using in multi segment foot modeling paper is actually somewhat similar to the structure of prostetics.

    <td>
      This class was about simulating motion of the body. Going through the papers in chronological order was useful in a sense that I could see where this technology started from and where it is going towards to. We started from controllers and moved towards to simplified versions. Some of them looked stiff and not very real like, however a lot of papers were trying to overcome it. I thought we made pretty big progresses after seeing the boston dynamics robots.

    <td>
      When I first thought about learning it was mostly deep learning stuff. This lecture was somewhat unexpected in that sense. We talked about optimization of motions from animals and human figures. I am still not very sure how they work exactly, but they seemed pretty complicated. It was interesting to see where these techniques can be used such as gaming.

      I think today's highlight was the bird paper. This was a paper about self-regulated learning where the authors looked into how to simulate bird's motions which deal with sharp turns and difficult maneuvers. It was nice to see terms like curriculum learning again after long time. The quadruped animal locomotion controller was one of the papers I looked into in the start of the semester. I think after looking at the phase based animation paper in class it helped me to understand it more than before. However it was still confusing.. Basketball paper I think this I also saw before.. it was similar to what we did in last lecture.

      We had one more paper presentation about reinforcement learning - markov decision process.. I think I heard this in computer vision. The result looks legit but I saw some jiggling in the hands in one of the clips. But it was interesting that you can also use keyframe information to simulate.
      I wanted to learn more about crowds and instancing before this semester, so this lecture was intriguing for me. Though simulation results looked not completely realistic, it was fun to watch. I think I really liked the shoulder motion paper even though it was not exactly a breakthrough, but the addition of such visual aid makes the simulations more believable.

      As we go to the end of the semester and we talk more about recent papers, I think the percentage of learning/data driven paper is increasing. I liked the pseudo human AI. It reminded me of the rollercoaster tycoon game I played and the reaction of npc characters in it. There were also a lot of locomotion paper with different subject/motions.. but I think I'm more into the emotion simulation then motion.

      We went through many different papers today and I will just write down some of my favorites. My favorite was the human object interaction paper. I felt like it was some kind of future living situations where machines will anticipate what humans will do and perform actions that will aid the human motion. I think this really has a lot of potential in different areas like helping the disables and so on. The ferrofluid paper was cool too. In my notes I just wrote one word: "Wow". Though I think it is a little bit too much for something that will probably not be used extensively.. Replacing human actor idea was good too but I guess it had a lot of room to improve. Overall I think I got a lot of exposure to graphics papers and concepts in this course. Thank you so much!
